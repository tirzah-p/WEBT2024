    <h2>How to start</h2>
    <p>When traveling on a budget, the first thing you need to do is plan and set a realistic budget for your trip. Determine how much you can afford to spend on accommodation, transportation, meals, and activities. Once you have a clear budget in mind, you can make informed decisions about where to stay, how to get around, and what activities to engage in while staying within your financial limits. Additionally, consider researching and booking affordable accommodation, transportation, and activities in advance to take advantage of any discounts or promotions. </p>
